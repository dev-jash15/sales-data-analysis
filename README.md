# Sales Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sales data using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The project addresses four key business questions:

1. Best Month for Sales: Identifies the month with the highest sales and the corresponding revenue.
2. Top-Selling City: Determines which city recorded the most product sales.
3. Optimal Advertisement Timing: Recommends the best time to display advertisements to maximize customer purchases.
4. Most Sold Product: Highlights the product with the highest sales volume.
